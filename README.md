Presented at DEFCON 26 & GrrCON, Dragnet is a social engineering framework which leverages AI to conduct spear-phishing & vishing at scale.

Read the abstract [here](https://defcon.org/html/defcon-26/dc-26-speakers.html#Kain).

# Getting started
There is a full readme [here](https://dragnet.gitbook.io/user-guide/), but the short version is:
- Everything in the admin directory can be set up on a cloud VM (preferably Ubuntu 18.x)
- client should be run locally
- functions will be deployed to cloud functions
- cron instructions will be posted later today (for scheduled emails only) - 9/26/18
- npm install anywhere you see a package.json
- keep the /root paths at your own risk ðŸ˜‡

*Development will be ongoing and commits will occur frequently. Check back often- as breaking changes are discovered, fixes will be pushed whenever possible.*
